							Hello! My name's Joshua Komala and I am currently a third year Computer Science major at the University of California, San Diego. I've always been interested in all things tech because of my mom, who studied Computer Science, and my brothers, who were always on the computer. They're the ones who got me into video games and I figured it would be cool to spend my time productively on the computer instead of simply playing games.

						<div class="panel-info right-align"> It was honestly surreal working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Summer of 2016. I was free to explore the campus as I pleased, I learned more than I could have imagined, and made many friends I hope to keep in touch with for many years to come.</div>

						<div class="panel-info right-align"> As stated in the left panel, I am an avid gamer. I recently started streaming on Twitch whenever I have time and need a second to relax. The image on the left is something I made on Illustrator, (as well as the Geisel Library image above) to act as a logo for my nickname, Shyyyk. </div>

						<div class="panel-info right-align"> Ultimate Frisbee is the only sport I've ever played competitively and seriously. A couple of my friends and I threw around a disc the summer after high school and I knew at that moment I wanted to join the team. The Air Squids, the Men's Ultimate Frisbee Club at UCSD, has taught me a lot about teamwork and friendship. </div>
