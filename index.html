						<div class="panel-info">
							Hello! My name's Joshua Komala and I am currently a fourth year Computer Science major at the University of California, San Diego. I've always been interested in all things tech because of my mom, who studied Computer Science, and my brothers, who were always on the computer. They're the ones who got me into video games and I figured it would be cool to spend my time productively on the computer instead of simply playing games.

						<img id="yahoo" class="clickable pic-circle" src="images/yahoo.png" />
						<div class="panel-info right-align"> After my third year of college, I was lucky enough to get a summer internship at Yahoo!. I had no idea what to expect and was honestly a bit nervous to work at such a big company, but was pleasantly surprised when I started. After the first day of orientation, I immediately met with my managers and was introduced to my team shortly after. Within the first few weeks I already felt as if I was a full time employee. I couldn't have been more happy with how it turned out and am extremely grateful for all the help I received while there. </div>

						<img id="jpl" class="clickable pic-circle" src="images/jpl.png" />
						<div class="panel-info right-align"> It was honestly surreal working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Summer of 2016. I was free to explore the campus as I pleased, I learned more than I could have imagined, and made many friends I hope to keep in touch with for many years to come.</div>

						<div class="panel-info right-align"> Food 4 Thought is an application a couple of friends of mine and I made during the school year. We made this app to help all UCSD students with the struggle that is finding an affordable and tasty place to eat on campus.  </div>
						<img id="foodforthought" class="clickable pic-circle" src="images/foodforthought.png" />
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						<div class="panel-info right-align"> Exposure is another app my friends and I made for a school project. Using the Flickr API, we were able to pull uploaded images as well as their geolocation and tags. To tie everything together, we used the Google Maps API to pin the clusters of images onto a map. </div>

						<div class="panel-info right-align"> As stated in the left panel, I am an avid gamer. I recently started streaming on Twitch whenever I have time and need a second to relax. The image on the left is something I made on Illustrator, (as well as the Geisel Library image above) to act as a logo for my nickname, Shyyyk. </div>

						<img id="airsquids" class="pic-circle" src="images/airsquids.jpg" />
						<div class="panel-info right-align"> Ultimate Frisbee is the only sport I've ever played competitively and seriously. A couple of my friends and I threw around a disc the summer after high school and I knew at that moment I wanted to join the team. The Air Squids, the Men's Ultimate Frisbee Club at UCSD, has taught me a lot about teamwork and friendship. </div>
